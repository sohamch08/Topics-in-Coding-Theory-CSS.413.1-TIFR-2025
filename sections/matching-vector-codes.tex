\section{Matching Vector Codes}
Here we give a detailed treatment of locally decodable codes that arise from families of matching vectors. Any construction of such codes naturally falls into two parts: the design of a matching vector family and the actual code construction. First we will discuss how to locally decode, and then we will talk about matching vector families. We will show the construction of 3-query LDCs.
